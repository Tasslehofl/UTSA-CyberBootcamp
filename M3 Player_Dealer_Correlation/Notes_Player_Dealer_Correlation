Went through the days which there were losses for the house.
One player appears on each day, and each time that there was a loss: Mylie Schmidt.
She could just be lucky, but to verify, cross referenced against the dealers during the same days/times.
Found that the same dealer, Billy Jones, was at the Roulette table at each of those days/times.

This is enough evidence to warrant going back to the video feed to review his table to see if the same indiviudal (Mylie Schmidt) is at his table.
